There two Python scripts :

1) FPGrowth.py
Dependencies - Pandas, Numpy
Execute as python FPGrowth.py from terminal

Input : 
Support as %
Confidence as %

Output : 
Standard counts of transactions, distinct items, frequent itemsets
Messages to convey background process, ex. Encoding, Inserting etc.
List of frequent itemsets along with frequency
List of closed frequent itemsets along with frequency
List of maximal frequent itemsets along with frequency
List of association rules along with confidence

2) apriori.py
Dependencies - Numpy
Execute normally

Input :
Support as %

Output :
List of frequent itemsets alongwith frequency

Note: The procedure for generating association rules, closed frequent itemsets, maximal frequent itemsets is same for both algorithms after frequent itemsets are generated, hence they are shown only in FPGrowth.py
